            <li>Factors are numbers we can multiply together to get another number. </li>
            <li>Example: `2` and `3` are factors of `6`, because `2 xx 3 = 6`. A number can have many factors.</li>
            <li>The multiples of a whole number are found by taking the product of any counting number and that whole number. The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of a set of whole numbers is the smallest multiple common to all whole numbers in the set. The highest common factor is the biggest multiple common to all whole numbers in the set.</li>
            <li>Difference between a factor and a multiple: Factors are what we can multiply to get the number. Multiples are what we get after multiplying the number by an integer (not a fraction).</li>
        </ul>

            <h6 class="block hide" id="hcf" class="hide" style="padding: 5px;">
                <li>Highest common factor of `a` and `b` is donated by `(a,b)`.
                <li>Here are the list of prime factors of `24` and `36`:</li>
    			<li>`24 = 2 xx 2 xx 2 xx 3`</li>
    			<li>`36 = 2 xx 2 xx 3 xx 3`</li>
    			<li>If we write down the numbers that are the same in both lists, they will give us the highest common factor of `24` and `36`.</li>
    			<li>`:.(24,36)=2 xx 2 xx 3 = 12`</li>
    			`***`Remember last topic we talked about rational numbers? To be more accurate, a rational number can be expressed in the way `p/q`, where `p` and `q` are both integers and `(p,q)=1`. The second condition may not seem important, but without it, it would be very difficult to prove some questions! (To read more about this, go on to Further Readings!)
